<h2>
<p>
I put a lot of time and effort into this final animation project, at the end I was very disappointed because the result was not what I was expecting, although I guess the short story I was trying to achieve was kind of interesting. I submitted it just because I had to, but I didnâ€™tlike this project at all. However I know this is part of the learning process.
